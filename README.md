ðŸŒ± HabituÃ© â€“ Introduction

In our day-to-day lives, we often struggle with inconsistencyâ€”whether itâ€™s sticking to a routine, building a new skill, or simply maintaining healthy habits. Over time, these small breaks lead to bigger gaps in our growth.

Thatâ€™s where the HabituÃ© comes in.

With features like short-term habit tracking, journaling, to-do lists, and long-term goal monitoring, it transforms discipline into an achievable, motivating, and rewarding journey.

The Habit Tracker app is designed to help users build consistency, stay motivated, and achieve their personal goals.
It features real-time cloud sync, personalized reminders, and interactive progress visualizations to boost user engagement and retention.

Home Page
The home screen of HabituÃ© welcomes users with a personalized greeting and a motivational quote to inspire consistency. A visual guide illustrates the step-by-step journey of habit formation, from setting goals to achieving them. Below it, three interactive cards provide quick access to core features: habit tracking for logging daily routines, progress visualization to monitor consistency, and personal blogging to capture reflections and experiences. The soothing purple theme and intuitive layout make navigation simple, engaging, and motivating.

Daily progress Tracking 
The Daily Progress Tracking module helps users stay consistent by monitoring their everyday habits. Users can easily mark habits as completed or not completed, ensuring accountability. Additionally, a built-in timer allows users to perform tasks with focusâ€”once the timer finishes, the habit is automatically marked as completed, making progress tracking seamless and motivating.

Short Term Progress Tracking
The Short-Term Progress Tracking module allows users to set small, time-bound goals (like two-week tasks) that build consistency step by step. Users can add task details, set deadlines, and even plan milestones or rewards for motivation. Progress can be tracked in two ways:
Manual Logs for check-ins and regular updates.
Checklists/Subtasks for breaking big goals into smaller actionable steps.
This system makes it easy to visualize progress, stay motivated with rewards, and develop discipline by completing daily or weekly milestones.

Long Term Progress Tracking
The long-term goal tracking feature allows users to focus on bigger, meaningful objectives that span weeks or months. Users can create long-term goals by setting a title, category, start and end dates, and even add motivational notes. Each goal is stored with customizable categories (like Personal, Work, or Fitness) to keep things organized.
Progress can be updated regularly, helping users visualize how far theyâ€™ve come and stay committed over the entire journey. Unlike short-term tasks, this module emphasizes consistency and discipline over time, making it perfect for developing life-changing habits or achieving larger milestones.

Add Notes or Journals â€“ Maintain a personal log alongside their habits.
Track Mistakes & Learnings â€“ Write down setbacks and what they learned from them.
