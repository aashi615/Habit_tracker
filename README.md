Daily progress Tracking 
The Daily Progress Tracking module helps users stay consistent by monitoring their everyday habits. Users can easily mark habits as completed or not completed, ensuring accountability. Additionally, a built-in timer allows users to perform tasks with focus—once the timer finishes, the habit is automatically marked as completed, making progress tracking seamless and motivating.

Short Term Progress Tracking
The Short-Term Progress Tracking module allows users to set small, time-bound goals (like two-week tasks) that build consistency step by step. Users can add task details, set deadlines, and even plan milestones or rewards for motivation. Progress can be tracked in two ways:
Manual Logs for check-ins and regular updates.
Checklists/Subtasks for breaking big goals into smaller actionable steps.
This system makes it easy to visualize progress, stay motivated with rewards, and develop discipline by completing daily or weekly milestones.

Long Term Progress Tracking
The long-term goal tracking feature allows users to focus on bigger, meaningful objectives that span weeks or months. Users can create long-term goals by setting a title, category, start and end dates, and even add motivational notes. Each goal is stored with customizable categories (like Personal, Work, or Fitness) to keep things organized.
Progress can be updated regularly, helping users visualize how far they’ve come and stay committed over the entire journey. Unlike short-term tasks, this module emphasizes consistency and discipline over time, making it perfect for developing life-changing habits or achieving larger milestones.
